# HTTP Routes

# Ignore favicon requests

# Map static resources from the /app/public folder to the /public path

#                    **** WARNING ****
# Enabling this exposes any controller and function to the web.
# ** This is a serious security issue if used online **
#
# For rapid development uncomment the following to add new controller.action endpoints
# without having to add them to the routes table.
# *       /:controller/:action                    :controller.:action
